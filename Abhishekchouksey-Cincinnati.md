#Cincinnati, OH

In 1790, the governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair, proceeded to establish Hamilton County and made Losantiville the 
county seat. St. Clair disliked the name Losantiville and changed the town's name to Cincinnati. The town's name is recognition of the 
Roman citizen soldier Cincinnatus.
